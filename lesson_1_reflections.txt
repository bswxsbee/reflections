How did viewing a diff between
two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?

It easily highlighted the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

if you make a mistake you can immediately revert

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro - flexibility and more logical commits
Con - you forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because the files are interrelated so if you didn't save one of the files
and it had dependencies then the project would break.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

first use git log to find the commit IDs then use git diff to compare them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you know that you can always go back to fix something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I have no clue. But I can do it.
