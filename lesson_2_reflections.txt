Why use git respositories?


How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area contains files ready to be committed while work directory
is only files in the folder; this lets you have control over what gets
committed

What are some situations when branches would be
helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
